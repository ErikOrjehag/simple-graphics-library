#Simple Graphics Library

SGL is a small graphics wrapper for [GDI+](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms533798(v=vs.85).aspx) designed to help windows C++ developers to draw stuff with very little effort. Please visit the [official website](http://orjehag.se/SGL) for more information.

## To do

Are you eager to get involved in this project? Fantastic! Here are some stuff that needs fixing.

* Hide some public variables and methods (Marked with a comment in the source).
* Minimize flickering caused by manual resize of the window.
* Make copyBrush() and copyPen() not return pointers.
* Make thread synchronization redundant if possible.
* Spell check the website.
* Code clean up by someone who's actually experienced in C++ (because I'm not).

We don't need a pile of extra features. Let's focus on creating a solid easy to use API.
