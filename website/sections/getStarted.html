  <h1 class="topPadding">How to get started</h1>
  <p>
    Setting up SGL is easy and you can do it in under 5 minutes. 
    When your download is complete, extract the files and place them in your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure that your SubSystem is set to WINDOWS .
    If you don't do this you'll probably get an error looking something like 
    <a target="_BLANK" href="img/subsystemerror.png">this</a>. 
    That's because the WinMain functions never gets called and therefore SGL is never initialized. 
    Here is an <a target="_BLANK" href="img/checksubsystem.png">image</a> showing you have to set the correct SubSystem in Visual Studio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Create a new cpp file and copy paste the sample code from the right box into your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations, you just made your first SGL program! Smack that compile button and enjoy the show.
