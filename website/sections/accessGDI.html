  <h1 class="topPadding">Accessing all GDI+ features</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Oh no, I'm missing a feature!</strong><br>
    Simplicity is nice but I really want to draw this 
    fancy thing but I'm missing too many features.
  </p>

    Dont worry! There is a way to access all the GDI+ 
    graphic features.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Synchronizing threads</strong><br>
    SGL is multithreaded so if you want to draw something
    manually without using the standard methods you'll have 
    to synchronize the threads. This is really easy to do.
    <br><i style="line-height: 300%;">ssgl->waitTillCanUseGraphics();</i><br>
    This will freeze your thread until the graphics objects are not 
    used by another thread. If you don't do this your program
    may occasionally crash if another thread tries to access
    the same memory as you are at the same time.
    <br><i style="line-height: 300%;">sgl->stopUsingGraphics();</i><br>
    This allows other threads to draw stuff again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Drawing width GDI+</strong><br>
    The method 
    <br><i style="line-height: 300%;">ssgl->useGDI();</i><br> 
    returns a pointer to the GDI+ graphics object used internally by SGL. 
    You can use this pointer to access all of the GDI+ graphics features. 
    Do not delete this pointer as it will remove the object from SGL 
    and future drawing will fail.
